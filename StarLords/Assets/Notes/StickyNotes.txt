Bump Map Steps:
Take Image: Convert to GrayScale
Increase Contrast and Brightness alot
Contrast about 80% increase
Contrast about 40% increase

Finally add a Gaussian blur of about 10 pixels to improve 
transitions from dark to light

Construct Station via Blocks

Drug to Look into: Adrafinil

Peeps are funny silly creatures. Remember to keep everything Fun!


Tiles Made:
Hydroponic Tiles
Radar Dish
Research Lab- Prodives  Science. Peeps surround plasma balls and stare  					hands raised. Science!


Tile - With surrounding Doors

Tiles Needed:
Dormitory - Increases the max amount of Peeps you can have  
MedBed   -  ( A bed peeps jump into to heal)

AirLock   - This is how peeps can exit into space to build stations 

Asteroid Harvesting Station

Solar Panel -collects nrg
Fusion Core - Floating BAtterys, no really lol
Thruster - Allows the movement of the station in a certain direction. 
				Each thruster adds a Force in a Direction, but
 				each Station added increases the masreducing
    			the effectiveness of thrusters.


Turret Tiles - Automated inner Defence (They shoot marshmellows)
Barracks  	 - A tile where fighter peeps can be requested to guard the internal station




TradeStation - Ships can be loaded with Cargo - Food,Minerals,Science
 				and can be sent to "Planets" or "Stations" to convert to 						
 				Credits, Credits can also be loaded to convert for a 							
 				resource

 				Animation - Peeps literally throw bags at each other, the recieving peep falls down, then goes in the trade ship before blasting off


Mine Deployment Station - Peeps stationed here start chucking mines 										
							out through an airlockVent
							The Mines are "smart" in that they will
							avoid detonating on the ship, and they will 										
							attempt to orbit the station's perimeter

Fighter Bay 	- 	Fighter Peeps can be assigned here to fly fighter ships to  					patrol the station, and do hit/run tactics.

Experimental Ion Cannon - Shoots a Concentrated Ion Beam in the  											
						  direction it is faceing

Ship Repair Station - Repairs ANY ship that docks here.

Conference Room  - Allows the Player to Draw an additional card 
 					during Draw Phase

Archives 				- Increases the Amount of Max Science a Player can  							have

Treasurey			- Increases the Amount of Max Credits a Player can  							have

Food Vault 			-  Increases the amount of Max Food a player can 								have

StockPile				- Increases the amound of Minerals a player can have


Section Lock 		- This Tile acts as a barrier to slow an invasion force 
 							from entering the next room

Invasion Station - Crashes a Ship into a Target Stations Tile, releasing all
 					assigned fighter peeps into the enemy station to reek  
 					mass havok

Cloning Lab 	-  Assign (2) Peeps here to constantly create new Peeps.

Teleport Pad - Peeps can use Teleport Pads to Travel to other Teleport 
 					pads and reduce distance costs

 					*poof*, + spin = Magic Teleporting. Maybe they do a dance?

Galactic News - Relays information as to what Commodity to sell and 
 					 buy based on economy, per Planet discovered.

Scout Station	- Assigned peeps set out to explore the map and discover
  					planets 


Poison Chamber	- A room that locks enemy peeps inside and releases deadly neurotoxins 
				  to kill them all


Recycling Station - Assigned Peeps can allow the player the option of scrapping 1 card per upgrade
(Shredder)			or scrapping multiple cards per stations. But 7 Card max means you can only have a combination of upgardes and stations that equate to 7
(Cards get floated into bin)


Escape Pods 	- If peeps have been cutoff from the station, and they are on 
				floating debris which is about to explode, they will rush to 
				the nearest escape pod, and attempt to rejoin the main ship.


//Destroying a Station is just the Cost of Building it?
Refunds 



//Once Barracks is created, orders can be given to fighter peeps


How Research Works: 

Research works uniquely in this game. 
	If you wish to upgrade a tile, it will cost the minerals + the science 	stated on the card. To upgrade a tile simply place an exact copy of 	the tile from your hand onto the duplicate tile on the board.

Research can also be used to increase:
	Economy Rates 	  (inf)
	Weapon Damage 	  (inf)
	Armour Resistance (Inf)

	Introduce new Tiles into the Infinity Deck.


// Happiness?




 Goal of the Game:
 	Mercenary Wars : Travel Through Space, find enemy stations and   
 							destroy them.
    






Since Rooms have Walls, the Flooring of a placed tile already partially exists, peeps can enter into a room thats partially built, but they are vulnerable to outside elements as the walls have not yet been erected.

Onces the walls are erected are erected everything works out normall then the objects inside etc.


Walls will be halfed in size and they will be placed back to back to mimic the original
idea


Utilize Parent-CHild Heirarchy. Once Peeps require pathfinding to Locations, they can do so based on relativity. 
IE The Station moves, the children move along with it

Station - Moved by Thrusters
	-Rooms
	-Objects
	-Peeps


To Detect Collision utilize HitBoxes (NOT COLLIDERS FROM UNITY), and then cross reference trajectory with all hitboxes in the game.
	When Optimizing, reduce the area into segments to reduce the number of Objects being checked against
